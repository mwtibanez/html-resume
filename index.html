            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I've always been a hard worker that loves to learn. My past experience has mainly been physical labor, like working as a mover or a delivery associate, but I've found I'm far more passionate about coding.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <h3>Smooth Transitions</h3>
                    <h4>January 2021 - January 2023</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My job at Smooth Transitions was to resettle clients into new homes, typically elderly people who could no longer live on their own. I would pack the things in their home with care, move, and unpack those things into their new home with the intention of recreating their original home to make the transition smooth (pun intended). This job required stamina, focus, and great customer service skills. In many cases, moving was not something our clients wanted, but needed, and often times they made that known. My goal here was to make sure that these clients were not just satisfied, but thrilled with their move in the end.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>i2Logistics</h3>
                    <h4>February 2023 - February 2025</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My job at i2Logistics was to deliver packages for Amazon. A typical day would start by being assigned a route and a van. I'd link Amazon's Flex app to the van and drive to a station where my route's packages would be prepared for me. I'd load my van in 15 minutes or less and depart for the day. A route would usually consist of 150 to 200 stops, with plenty of challenges to contend with throughout the day, such as dogs protecting their property, the GPS unable to find an address, rough or rocky properties, and plenty of walking. My customer service skills would also come in handy, because customers loved to talk to their driver and ask questions about Amazon.</li>
