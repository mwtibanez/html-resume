<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Video Games: I have a deep appreciation for storytelling via an interactive medium like video games. I enjoy a good book, and while I can envision a climactic event from the words on a page, there's nothing like participating in one yourself with a character that moves on your command.</li>
    <li>Action Figures: Similar to video games, a picture of a favorite character is nice, but I love bringing my favorite characters to life in a 3D space. I feel the engineering and artistry that goes into designing an action figure generally goes unappreciated.</li>
    <li>Drawing: I love to recreate the things I see on paper. Drawing is cathartic, and an exercise in dexterity. Who doesn't appreciate a nice picture?</li>
